# clothing-website-using-3-tier-architecture-
The goal of this project is to provide a basic online platform where users can search for clothing items and view details such as name and price.   As the Cloud Engineer on this project, I was responsible for designing and deploying the entire infrastructure on AWS. The application is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, RDS as its database service.
