# clothing-website-using-3-tier-architecture-
The goal of this project is to provide a basic online platform where users can search for clothing items and view details such as name and price.   As the Cloud Engineer on this project, I was responsible for designing and deploying the entire infrastructure on AWS. The application is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, RDS as its database service.

##Steps for make architecture 

Got it âœ… â€” hereâ€™s a **step-by-step guide** to launch a **3-Tier Architecture** on AWS manually using **VPC, EC2, and RDS** (no auto-scaling).

This is the most common setup:

* **Tier 1 â€“ Presentation Layer:** Public Subnet â†’ EC2 (Web Server)
* **Tier 2 â€“ Application Layer:** Private Subnet â†’ EC2 (App Server)
* **Tier 3 â€“ Database Layer:** Private Subnet â†’ RDS (Database)

## ðŸš€ **Step-by-Step Setup**

### **Step 1: Create VPC & Subnets**

1. Go to **VPC Console â†’ Create VPC**

   * Name: `3tier-vpc`
   * CIDR Block: `10.0.0.0/16`
2. Create **Subnets**:

   * **Public Subnet**  â†’ Name: `public-subnet`
   * **Private Subnet (App)**  â†’ Name: `private-app-subnet`
   * **Private Subnet (DB)**  â†’ Name: `private-db-subnet`
3. Create **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

   * Attach it to `3tier-vpc`
4. Update **Route Tables**:

   * Public Route Table â†’ Add Route â†’ `0.0.0.0/0` â†’ Target: IGW
   * Associate Public Route Table with `public-subnet`
   * Private Route Table â†’ No direct internet access

### **Step 2: Launch Public EC2 (Web Server)**

1. Go to **EC2 Console â†’ Launch Instance**
2. AMI: Amazon Linux 2
3. Instance type: `t2.micro` (free-tier)
4. Network settings:

   * Select VPC: `3tier-vpc`
   * Subnet: `public-subnet`
   * Auto-assign Public IP: ENABLE
5. Security Group:

   * Allow HTTP (80) from `0.0.0.0/0`
   * Allow SSH (22) from your IP
6. Launch â†’ Download Key Pair
---

### **Step 3: Launch Private EC2 (App Server)**

1. Go to **EC2 Console â†’ Launch Instance**
2. Same AMI (Amazon Linux 2)
3. Instance type: `t2.micro`
4. Network settings:

   * VPC: `3tier-vpc`
   * Subnet: `private-app-subnet`
   * Auto-assign Public IP: DISABLE
5. Security Group:

   * Allow SSH (22) from Public EC2 Security Group 
   * Allow Custom TCP  from Public EC2 
6. Launch â†’ Connect via SSH through **Bastion/Jump Host** (your Public EC2)
7. Install Application Server (Node.js, PHP, etc.)

---

### **Step 4: Create Database (RDS)**

1. Go to **RDS Console â†’ Create Database**
2. Engine: MySQL (or PostgreSQL)
3. DB instance class: `db.t3.micro`
4. VPC: `3tier-vpc`
5. Subnet group: Select `private-db-subnet`
6. Security Group:

   * Allow MySQL/Aurora (3306) **only from App Server Security Group**
7. Disable Public Access
8. Create Database


* From there, SSH into Private EC2
* Check DB connection from Private EC2:
